# My Vim configuration

This is just a configuration I use to code and edit text in Vim. I wanted to have it available in case I use a different machine, hence this repo.

The configuration uses some plugins not included in this repo. For convenience, I have a list of plugins below

## Plugins

* [gruvbox][1] 
* [indentLine][2] 
* [lightline.vim][3] 
* [vim-gitbranch][4] 
* [The NERDTree][5] 
* [YouCompleteMe][6]
