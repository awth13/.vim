# My Vim configuration

This is just a configuration I use to code and edit text in Vim. I wanted to have it available in case I use a different machine, hence this repo.

The configuration uses some plugins not included in this repo. For convenience, I have a list of plugins below

## Plugins

    * [gruvbox][1] colorscheme
    * [indentLine][2] displays lines at indentation levels
    * [lightline.vim][3] light-weight statusline
    * [vim-gitbranch][4] provides a function returning the name of the current git branch
    * [The NERDTree][5] file system explorer 
    * [YouCompleteMe][6] code completion engine
