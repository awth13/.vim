# My Vim configuration

This is just a configuration I use to code and edit text in Vim. I wanted to have it available in case I use a different machine, hence this repo.

The configuration uses some plugins not included in this repo. For convenience, I have a list of plugins below

## Plugins

* [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme
* [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine) adds indent lines
* [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) light-weight statusline
* [vim-gitbranch](https://github.com/itchyny/vim-gitbranch) allows getting current git branch name
* [The NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) file system explorer
* [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) autocomplete engine
