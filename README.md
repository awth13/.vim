# My Vim configuration

This is just a configuration I use to code and edit text in Vim. I wanted to have it available in case I use a different machine, hence this repo.

The configuration uses some plugins not included in this repo. For convenience, I have a list of plugins below

## Plugins

    * [gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) colorscheme
    * [indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine) displays lines at indentation levels
    * [lightline.vim](https://github.com/itchyny/lightline.vim) light-weight statusline
    * [vim-gitbranch](https://github.com/itchyny/vim-gitbranch) provides a function returning the name of the current git branch
    * [The NERDTree](https://github.com/preservim/nerdtree) file system explorer 
    * [YouCompleteMe](https://github.com/ycm-core/YouCompleteMe) code completion engine
